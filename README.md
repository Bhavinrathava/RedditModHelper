# RedditModHelper

### What does this tool do ?
Generates a dashboard for analysing the top "Hot" posts from a given reddit and analyses the violations of Community Rules for each of the posts to help analyze the content and potential violations easily. 

### Setup Steps :
You will need a Reddit Bot credential file with your own credentials for reddit Bot. 
You will also need a mongoDB Cluster for storing the content and analysis. 
You can run the dashboard locally since the data can be fetched from Mongo Remotely. 

### Next Steps : 
I plan to expand the functionality to develop similar tool for comment contents as well. 
Further touchup of Dashboard with more intuitive controls is on the way !
