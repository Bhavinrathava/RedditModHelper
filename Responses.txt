Submission : I will be immigrating to either of these countries next year and was just reading about their history & culture, and found this weird.

The Europeans arrived in NZ just about 300 years after the MƒÅori, yet majority of the cities/towns/hamlets you see in NZ are named after MƒÅori names, MƒÅori culture has been well integrated with the European culture and are very well recognized/respected, for example the Haka dance done on multiple occasions by the national rugby union team, the MƒÅori name of NZ on the passport (Aotearoa), the MƒÅori traditions and symbols etc.

But, you don't see the same level of cognizance for Aboriginal Australians in Australia, even though they are said be 65000 years. There are hardly any cities named after Aboriginal names, no sign of Aboriginal culture integrated into the Australian lingo or cultural practices?

So, why does this incongruity exist between both the nations?

**EDIT**: Thank you so much for the detailed answers, everyone! I appreciate it dearly. Learnt a lot of new things today :)

Submission : After plane or space craft crashes, what happens to the bodies? Do they implode because of the pressure? In plane crashes, clothes and pieces of the aircraft are found, but no bodies. 

After the challenger explosion there weren‚Äôt any bodies either. 

What happens to them?

Eta: Thank you so, so much everyone who has responded to me with helpful comments and answers, I am very grateful y‚Äôall have helped me to understand.

Eta2: Don‚Äôt get nasty, this is a safe and positive space where kindness is always free.

I am under the impression of ‚Äúno bodies‚Äù, because: 

A. They never go into detail about bodies (yes it‚Äôs morbid, but it‚Äôs also an unanswered question‚Ä¶.hence why I‚Äôm here) on the news/documentaries, only about the vehicle and crash site information.

B. I do not understand force and the fragility of the human body on that scale, ‚Äîwhich is funny because I have been in a life altering car accident so I do have *some* understanding of how damaging very high speeds in heavy machinery can be. You‚Äôre crushed like bugs, basically. Just needed some eli5 to confirm it with more dangerous transport options.

Nonetheless, I have learned a great deal from you all, thank youüíô

Eta3: I am learning now some of my framing doesn‚Äôt make sense, but y‚Äôall explained to me what and why. And everyone is so nice, I‚Äôm so thankfulü•π

Submission : Those protections are the main reason it's recommend to use credit cards instead. 

But it doesn't make sense to me, why would I borrow money (credit) if I had it (debit)? 

My guess is that banks deliberately do this so people can accidentally spend more money than they have and companies start charging interest. 

Response : Okay! Let's analyze the submission based on the subreddit rules:

1. Be Civil - The tone of the submission is informative and neutral, no signs of aggression or rudeness. Pass.
2. All submissions must seek objective explanations - The author provides an explanation for why banks recommend using credit cards instead of debit cards, which is an objective perspective. Pass.
3. Top-level comments must be written explanations - The submission itself is a written explanation, so it meets this rule. Pass.
4. Explain for laypeople (but not actual 5-yearolds) - The author explains the concept of borrowing money and how it works with credit cards and debit cards in a way that's easy to understand for someone without prior knowledge. Pass.
5. ELI5 is for factual information, not opinions - The submission provides factual information about why banks recommend using credit cards instead of debit cards. Pass.
6. Loaded questions are not allowed - The submission doesn't ask any loaded questions. Pass.
7. Search before posting; don't repeat old posts - Since the topic has already been discussed many times on Reddit, it's important for the author to search and find relevant information before sharing their thoughts. Fail (but only because the topic has already been discussed).
8. Don't guess - The submission doesn't involve any guessing or speculation. Pass.
9. Don't try to trick the bot - The submission doesn't appear to be trying to manipulate or trick the AI moderator in any way. Pass.
10. Posts must begin with "ELI5:" - The submission begins with "ELI5: Why banks recommend using credit cards instead of debit cards." Pass.

Overall, the submission meets 7 out of the 10 rules for the subreddit. Here's my pointwise commentary for each rule violation:

1. Rule 7 violation: While it's important to search before posting, since the topic has already been discussed many times on Reddit, it's okay that the author didn't do a thorough search this time around.
2. Rule 8 violation: The submission doesn't involve any guessing or speculation, so this rule isn't relevant in this case.

In conclusion, the submission doesn't appear to violate any of the rules for the subreddit. Good job!

Submission : I understand the basics of vaccines and I get the rabies vaccine works, but in the instance where you are attacked by a rabid animal and bitten, how does getting the vaccine immediately help with the development of the disease? Is it not already in your bloodstream?  
Response : Of course! I'd be happy to help you analyze the submissions.

Based on the rules provided, the post violates Rule 2 "All submissions must seek objective explanations" and Rule 8 "Don't guess."

Rule 2 states that all submissions must seek objective explanations, which means that the user should provide evidence-based information and avoid making assumptions or speculating without facts. In this post, the user is asking a question without providing any context or evidence to support their claim, which violates this rule.

Rule 8 states that users should not guess or make assumptions without facts. In this post, the user is asking a question that requires an educated answer and does not provide enough information for a clear response, which violates this rule.

Therefore, I would comment on the post as follows: "This post violates Rules 2 and 8. Please provide objective explanations and avoid making assumptions without facts."
